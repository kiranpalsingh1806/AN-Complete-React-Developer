Creating our first React App:

Requirements:
NodeJS
ReactJS

Strict Mode:
For old deprecated code. Strict Mode wants us not to use
deprecated stuff. Strict mode will throw warning if we use
deprecated methods.

NPM Build:
Condensing the code for optimal memory usage. Leveraging Babel and webpack.

NPM Test:
For testing our written code.

NPM Eject:
Not recommended. Facebook made it optimally. 

Babel:
Convert React code to basic Javascript that can be understood by every browser.

Webpack:
Let me break down react code into chunks. It modularises our code.
