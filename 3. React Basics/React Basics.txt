Section 3: React Basics

Requirements:
NodeJS
ReactJS

Strict Mode:
For old deprecated code. Strict Mode wants us not to use
deprecated stuff. Strict mode will throw warning if we use
deprecated methods.

NPM Build:
Condensing the code for optimal memory usage. Leveraging Babel and webpack.

NPM Test:
For testing our written code.

Babel:
Convert React code to basic Javascript that can be understood by every browser.

Webpack:
Let me break down react code into chunks. It modularises our code.

24.NPM Eject
Not recommended. Facebook made it optimally. 
Creates config folder.
Also creater jest folder, webpack configuration etc.

25. Hooks vs Classes
Hooks is new concept. It solves many problems with classes.

26. Using Class Component in React
Using constructor(), super(), render()

27. Thinking JSX
className, { }, onClick is Camelcase instead of onclick in html.
JSX is trying to mimic HTML to create the virtual DOM to break down the app into
component and we can change state of the DOM.

28. Dynamic Content

29. map() + key attribute

30. Single Page Application
Requesting data instead of HTML pages.
